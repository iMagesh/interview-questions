## Ruby Interview Questions

- **How to understand nil vs. empty vs. blank in Rails (and Ruby)**
  `.nil?` can be used on any object and is true if the object is nil.

  `.empty?` can be used on strings, arrays and hashes and returns true if:

  ```
  String length == 0
  Array length == 0
  Hash length == 0
  ```

  Running `.empty?` on something that is nil will throw a NoMethodError.

  That is where `.blank?` comes in. It is implemented by Rails and will operate on any object as well as work like `.empty?` on strings, arrays and hashes.

  ```
  nil.blank? == true
  false.blank? == true
  [].blank? == true
  {}.blank? == true
  "".blank? == true
  5.blank? == false
  0.blank? == false
  ```

  `.blank?` also evaluates true on strings which are non-empty but contain only whitespace:

  ```
  "  ".blank? == true
  "  ".empty? == false
  ```

  Rails also provides `.present?`, which returns the negation of `.blank?`.

  Array gotcha: blank? will return false even if all elements of an array are blank. To determine blankness in this case, use all? with blank?, for example:

  ```
  [ nil, '' ].blank? == false
  [ nil, '' ].all? &:blank? == tru
  ```

- **How to call shell commands from Ruby?**
  This explanation is based on a commented [Ruby script][1] from a friend of mine. If you want to improve the script, feel free to update it at the link.

  First, note that when Ruby calls out to a shell, it typically calls `/bin/sh`, _not_ Bash. Some Bash syntax is not supported by `/bin/sh` on all systems.

  Here are ways to execute a shell script:

      cmd = "echo 'hi'" # Sample string that can be used

  1.  <code>Kernel#\`</code> , commonly called backticks â€“ <code>\`cmd\`</code>

      This is like many other languages, including Bash, PHP, and Perl.

      Returns the result (i.e. standard output) of the shell command.

      Docs: http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-60

                value = `echo 'hi'`
                value = `#{cmd}`

  2.  Built-in syntax, `%x( cmd )`

      Following the `x` character is a delimiter, which can be any character.
      If the delimiter is one of the characters `(`, `[`, `{`, or `<`,
      the literal consists of the characters up to the matching closing delimiter,
      taking account of nested delimiter pairs. For all other delimiters, the
      literal comprises the characters up to the next occurrence of the
      delimiter character. String interpolation `#{ ... }` is allowed.

      Returns the result (i.e. standard output) of the shell command, just like the backticks.

      Docs: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/language.html

              value = %x( echo 'hi' )
              value = %x[ #{cmd} ]

  3.  `Kernel#system`

      Executes the given command in a subshell.

      Returns `true` if the command was found and run successfully, `false` otherwise.

      Docs: http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-system

            wasGood = system( "echo 'hi'" )
            wasGood = system( cmd )

  4.  `Kernel#exec`

      Replaces the current process by running the given external command.

      Returns none, the current process is replaced and never continues.

      Docs: http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-exec

            exec( "echo 'hi'" )
            exec( cmd ) # Note: this will never be reached because of the line above

  Here's some extra advice:
  `$?`, which is the same as `$CHILD_STATUS`, accesses the status of the last system executed command if you use the backticks, `system()` or `%x{}`.
  You can then access the `exitstatus` and `pid` properties:

            $?.exitstatus

- **What is attr_accessor in Ruby?**

  Let's say you have a class `Person`.

  ```ruby
  class Person
  end

  person = Person.new
  person.name # => no method error
  ```

  Obviously we never defined method `name`. Let's do that.

  ```ruby
  class Person
    def name
    @name # simply returning an instance variable @name
    end
  end

  person = Person.new
  person.name # => nil
  person.name = "Dennis" # => no method error
  ```

  Aha, we can read the name, but that doesn't mean we can assign the name. Those are two different methods. The former is called _reader_ and latter is called _writer_. We didn't create the writer yet so let's do that.

  ```ruby
  class Person
    def name
    @name
    end

    def name=(str)
      @name = str
    end

  end

  person = Person.new
  person.name = 'Dennis'
  person.name # => "Dennis"
  ```

  Awesome. Now we can write and read instance variable `@name` using reader and writer methods. Except, this is done so frequently, why waste time writing these methods every time? We can do it easier.

  ```ruby
  class Person
    attr_reader :name
    attr_writer :name
  end
  ```

  Even this can get repetitive. When you want both reader and writer just use accessor!

  ```ruby
  class Person
    attr_accessor :name
  end

  person = Person.new
  person.name = "Dennis"
  person.name # => "Dennis"
  ```

  Works the same way! And guess what: the instance variable `@name` in our person object will be set just like when we did it manually, so you can use it in other methods.

  ```ruby
  class Person
    attr_accessor :name

    def greeting
      "Hello #{@name}"
    end

  end

  person = Person.new
  person.name = "Dennis"
  person.greeting # => "Hello Dennis"
  ```

  That's it. In order to understand how `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and `attr_accessor` methods actually generate methods for you, read other answers, books, ruby docs.
